Why DeFi?

During the lock-down and with so much time to think, read, and research I think is
important to prioritize future projects and stay focus on DeFi projects only.

It is no brainer that the finance industry is entering into a rapid change by
decentralizing and removing the middle man in loans, insurance, new ways to earn
interest and investing.

The technology is already here! It is time to shake the central banks, politics around money, and wall street!
